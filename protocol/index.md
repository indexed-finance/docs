# Indexed Finance

Indexed Finance is a protocol for on-chain financial metrics and portfolio management. Our primary objectives are:
- Creating DeFi primitives for dynamic asset pools.
- Developing passive portfolio management strategies using on-chain data.
- Expanding and simplifying access to DeFi for users.


## Defi Indices
Our first DeFi product is a capitalization-weighted index pool controller that tracks specific sectors of the DeFi market and dynamically adjusts pool compositions according to market trends. By combining on-chain price data with preset rules that determine portfolio targets, these funds enable easy exposure to DeFi without introducing bias from asset managers and serve as objective benchmarks of DeFi markets.
