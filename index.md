# Indexed

Indexed is a protocol for passively managed token portfolios. The NDX governance organization creates portfolio management contracts that use preset rules to turn market indicators into portfolio management strategies.

Building on previous work by the Balancer team, Indexed portfolios are asset pools that double as AMMs. Pool controller contracts set weight targets for the assets in a pool and arbitragers balance them through swaps. This results in funds that gain fees from rebalances rather than paying them to external markets.
