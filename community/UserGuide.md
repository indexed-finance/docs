## **Purchasing the Index Tokens**

### Steps:

### 1. Connect your web3 wallet to the indexed.finance website (orders done this way will have a slightly higher spot price than the value of that index token, mint the index token for a better price)

*You can also make a spot order for one of the index tokens directly on [Uniswap] (this link directs to the DEFI Top 5 Index)*

## **Minting the Index Tokens**
Another option is to mint one of the index tokens using the underlying tokens that make up the index. This is going to be the most cost efficient option if you already hold each of the tokens in the index you are looking to mint. 

### Steps:

### 1. Connect your web3 wallet to the indexed.finance website

### 2. Click on the index token you would like to mint

### 3. Type how many index pool tokens you would like to mint

### 4. Check that your wallet holds of each underlying token to mint the index token (you won't be able to mint the index token if you don't) 

### 5. Click "Mint" and you will recieve the single index tokens in your wallet shortly

## **Burning the Index Tokens** 
Burning the index tokens is just the opposite of minting them, if you hold index tokens, you can destroy index tokens for the underlying assets if you would like to trade them seperatley, stake them, or participate in that project's governance proposals 
Steps:
### 1. Connect your web3 wallet to the indexed.finance website

### 2. Type how many index pool tokens you would like to burn

### 3. Type how many index pool tokens you would like to destroy
